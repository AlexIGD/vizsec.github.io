In this keynote, Richard Bejtlich discussed the strengths and weaknesses of using security visualization in the enterprise.  For example, why do analysts consistently refer to traditional displays, despite nearly ten years of work in the visualization arena?  Why are most security products so limited when rendering data?  What must be done to change this situation?  Richard explored these topics based on experiences as Principal Technologist and Director of Incident Response for General Electric.</p><p><a href='http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/'>Richard Bejtlich</a> is Director of Incident Response for General Electric, and serves as Principal Technologist for GE's Global Infrastructure Services division.  Prior to GE, Richard operated TaoSecurity LLC as an independent consultant, protected national security interests for ManTech Corporation's Computer Forensics and Intrusion Analysis division, investigated intrusions as part of Foundstone's incident response team, and monitored client networks for Ball Corporation.  Richard began his digital security career as a military intelligence officer at the Air Force Computer Emergency Response Team (AFCERT), Air Force Information Warfare Center (AFIWC), and Air Intelligence Agency (AIA).  Richard is a graduate of Harvard University and the United States Air Force Academy.

Co-located this year with the Symposium on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection (RAID), the 7th VizSec will continue to provide opportunities for the two communities to collaborate and share insights into providing solutions for security needs through visualization approaches. Accepted papers will appear in the ACM Digital Library as part of the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series.</p><p>This year our focus is on understanding what makes effective visual interfaces for different cyber security tasks. This involves both advancing our understanding of what cyber security tasks are, and improving our understanding of what it means for a security visualization to be effective. Cyber security visualization tasks cover a wide range, including (but not limited to) acquiring situational awareness in massive datasets; analyzing data from disparate sources during incident handling; producing actionable reports for others; modelling the behaviour of systems; and predicting future events. Understanding the effectiveness of a cyber security visualization is not limited only to the usability of the interface itself, but, perhaps even more importantly, to the assessment of how the visualization advances security goals. Barriers confronting current researchers include understanding the tasks where visualization can be effective, concerns about available data for both usability and effectiveness assessment, lack of a common agreement about what constitutes sound experimental design, and the difficulties of measuring the relative effectiveness of security visualizations in practice. Additionally, discussions at VizSec 2009 raised the question about what role a science-based approach ought to play in the conjunction of visualization and security. While many researchers are making progress in these and other critical areas, much work remains.</p><h3>Technical Papers</h3><p>Full and short papers, poster abstracts and panel abstracts offering novel contributions in security visualization are solicited. Papers may present technique, applications, practical experience, theory, or experiments and evaluations. Papers are encouraged on technologies and methods that have been demonstrated to be useful for improving information systems security and that address lessons from actual application. We encourage papers that report results on visualization techniques and systems in solving all aspects of cyber security problems, including how visualization applies to:</p><ul><li>Situational awareness/understanding</li><li>Incident handling including triage, exploration, correlation, and response</li><li>Recording and reporting results of investigation</li><li>Modelling system and network behaviour</li><li>Criteria for assessing the effectiveness of cyber security visualizations (whether from a security goal perspective or a human factors perspective)</li><li>Predicting future attacks or targets</li><li>Evaluation/user testing of VizSec systems</li><li>Lessons learned</li><li>Privacy considerations for managing VizSec data</li></ul><p>Accepted papers and abstracts will appear in the ACM Digital Library. The program committee will select an accepted paper to receive the VizSec 2010 best paper award. A key element of the best paper selection process will be whether the results are believed to be repeatable by other scientists based on the algorithms and data provided in the paper.</p><p>It is anticipated that authors of the best papers will be invited to extend and revise their paper for journal publication in a special issue, as in previous years.</p></section><section id="sub"><div class="page-header"><h2>Submissions</h2></div><p>Papers should be formatted using either the ACM word template or the ACM LaTeX template. Authors should apply <a href='http://www.acm.org/about/class/1998'>ACM Computing Classification categories and terms</a>. Full and short paper submissions should be anonymous; authors should remove their names and identifying information from the paper before submission. Poster and panel abstracts do not need to be anonymized; poster abstracts should be the final camera-ready version.</p><p>Please submit PDF papers using the EasyChair VizSec 2010 site.</p><ul><li>Full papers should be at most 12 pages, including the bibliography and appendices.</li><li>Short papers should be at most 6 pages, including the bibliography and appendices.</li><li>Poster and panel abstracts should be 2 pages, including the bibliography and appendices.</li></ul><p>Committee members are not required to read the appendices, or any pages past the maximum. Submissions not meeting these guidelines will be rejected without consideration of their merits. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference, preferably by themselves or by prior arrangement through a delegate.</p><h3>Student/First-Year Faculty Member Attendance Grants</h3><p>The VizSec 2010 organizing committee is pleased to announce that we are now accepting applications for grants to support student and first-year faculty member attendance at the symposium.
