Co-located this year with the <a href='http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2011/'>Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS)</a>, the 8th VizSec will provide new opportunities for the usability and visualization communities to collaborate and share insights on a broad range of security-related topics. Accepted papers will appear in the <a href='http://portal.acm.org/'>ACM Digital Library</a> as part of the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series.</p><p>Important research problems often lie at the intersection of disparate domains. This year our focus is to explore effective, scalable visual interfaces for security domains, where visualization may provide a distinct benefit, including computer forensics, reverse engineering, insider threat detection, cryptography, privacy, preventing â€œuser assistedâ€ attacks, compliance management, wireless security, secure coding, and penetration testing in addition to traditional network security. Human time and attention are precious resources. We are particularly interested in visualization and interaction techniques that effectively capture human analyst insights so that further processing may be handled by machines, freeing the analyst for other tasks. For example, a malware analyst might use a visualization system to analyze a new piece of malicious software and then facilitate generating a signature for future machine processing. When appropriate, research that incorporates multiple data sources, such as network packet captures, firewall rulesets and logs, DNS logs, web server logs, and/or intrusion detection system logs, is particularly desirable.</p><h3>Technical Papers</h3><p>Full paper and panel abstracts offering novel contributions in security visualization are solicited. Papers may present technique, applications, practical experience, theory, or experiments and evaluations. Papers are encouraged on technologies and methods that have been demonstrated to be useful for improving information systems security and that address lessons from actual application. We encourage papers that report results on visualization techniques and systems in solving all aspects of cyber security problems, including how visualization applies to:</p><ul><li>Situational awareness / understanding</li><li>Incident handling including triage, exploration, correlation, and response</li><li>Computer forensics</li><li>Recording and reporting results of investigation</li><li>Reverse engineering and malware analysis</li><li>Privacy</li><li>Multiple data source analysis</li><li>Analyzing information requirements for computer network defense</li><li>Evaluation / User testing of VizSec systems</li><li>Criteria for assessing the effectiveness of cyber security visualizations (whether from a security goal perspective or a human factors perspective)</li><li>Modeling system and network behavior</li><li>Modeling attacker and defender behavior</li><li>Studying risk and impact of cyber attacks</li><li>Predicting future attacks or targets</li><li>Security metrics and education</li><li>Lessons learned</li></ul><h3>Awards</h3><p>Accepted papers will appear in the ACM Digital Library. The program committee will select an accepted paper to receive the VizSec 2011 Best Paper award. A key element of the best paper selection process will be whether the results are believed to be repeatable by other scientists based on the algorithms and data provided in the paper.</p></section><section id="sub"><div class="page-header"><h2>Submissions</h2></div><p>Please submit PDF papers using <a href='https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vizsec2011'>the EasyChair VizSec 2011 site</a>.</p><p>Papers should be formatted using ACM templates (see below).
