<h5>Visualization in an Autonomic World: Establishing Trust, Maintaining Control, and Imparting Resilience</h5>

<p>The increasingly time-sensitive requirements that bind logical and physical realms is driving an ecosystem of users,
    software, hardware, and physical systems towards a world where autonomic control is the norm, not the exception. For
    example, some critical infrastructure components must react to threats and hazards on the time scale of milliseconds
    but are managed and operated by human practitioners who operate at a seconds-to-hours time scale. From this
    perspective, hierarchical control that imparts some degree of autonomy on subsystems is therefore essential for
    operating in the presence of non-innumerable adversarial and natural hazards. But as systems make more of their own
    decisions, humans have an increasing need for visualization for 1) transparency into autonomous subsystem
    decision-making; 2) sensing and control; and 3) reasoning over possible future states of the system. Transparency is
    essential for building trust in autonomous decision making. Understanding current system state is a prerequisite for
    efficient operation. The ability to reason over possible future states provides a basis for prioritizing proactive
    and reactive actions to drive overall system survivability and resilience. As long as humans remain in (or on) these
    decision loops, there will be a need to visualize complex and dynamic state information—reflecting the system’s
    past, present, and future. As these systems grow in complexity, interconnectedness, and autonomy, new paradigms of
    visualization will be essential for safe and efficient operation and control.

<h5>Biography</h5>

<p>Chris received his B.A. in physics and mathematics from Saint Louis University in 1995. He earned M.S. and Ph.D.
    degrees in biomedical engineering from the University of Memphis/University of Tennessee, HSC Joint program in 1999
    and 2003, respectively. Since then, he has been at PNNL as a research scientist, previously serving as the lead for
    the Asymmetric Resilient Cybersecurity Initiative. His research is built on a foundation of high performance
    computing applications in biology, with special emphasis on how these biological approaches can be used as a new
    paradigm for other fields such as cybersecurity. He has led multiple efforts focused on adaptive, resilient cyber
    systems inspired in part by complex biological systems. His resilience and active defense work rely on a
    foundational application of biological principles for survivability and regeneration with special emphasis on
    facilitating human control of complex systems.</p>

<h3>Call for Papers</h3>

<p>The 16th IEEE Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec) is a forum that brings together
    researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry to address the needs of the cyber
    security community through new and insightful visualization and analysis techniques. VizSec provides an
    excellent venue for fostering greater exchange and new collaborations on a broad range of security- and
    privacy-related topics. VizSec will be held in <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> in conjunction with <a
            href="http://ieeevis.org/">IEEE VIS</a>, on <strong>Wednesday, October 23rd 2019</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    This year, VizSec will be more closely integrated with the IEEE VIS program. VizSec will take place
    during the main week of the conference, giving VizSec authors and attendees enhanced access to IEEE VIS,
    the premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual
    analytics.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of VizSec is to explore effective and scalable visual interfaces for security domains such
    as network security, computer forensics, reverse engineering, insider threat detection, cryptography,
    privacy, user assisted attacks prevention, compliance management, wireless security, secure coding, and
    penetration testing.
</p>

</p>

<h4>Technical Papers</h4>
<p>
    Full papers describing novel contributions in security visualization are solicited. Papers may present techniques,
    applications, theory, analysis, experiments, or evaluations. We encourage the submission of papers on technologies
    and methods that promise to improve cyber security practices, including, but not limited to::
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Situation awareness and/or understanding</li>
    <li> Incident handling including triage, exploration, correlation, and response</li>

<p>
    Submissions including tests and evaluations of existing tools and techniques are also considered particularly
    desirable. If possible, making the data used for the tests available will also be considered positively. If you do
    not have real-world data to demonstrate your visualization, you may be interested in looking at the <a
        href="http://vacommunity.org/tiki-index.php">VAST Challenge Data Sets</a> page.
</p>

<h4>Short Papers</h4>
<p>Short papers describing initial research results, concise research contributions or incremental work on the above
    topics, even including practical applications of security visualization, are solicited. We encourage the submission
    of papers discussing the introduction of cyber security visualizations into operational context, including, but not
    limited to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Cases where visualization made positive contributions towards meeting operational needs</li>
    <li>Gaps or negative outcomes from visualization deployments</li>
    <li>Situations where visualization was not utilized, but could have had a positive impact</li>
    <li>Lessons learned from operational engagements</li>
    <li>Insights gained from the transition process</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <br/>
    Cyber security practitioners from industry, as well as the research community, are encouraged to submit case
    studies.
</p>

<h4>Posters</h4>
<p>
    Poster submissions may showcase late-breaking results, work in progress, preliminary results, or visual
    representations relevant to the VizSec community. The poster program will be a great opportunity for the authors to
    interact with the attendees, potentially also through live demos, and solicit feedback. Accepted poster abstracts
    will be made available on this website.
</p>


<a class="page-anchor" id="awards"></a>
<h3>Awards</h3>
<p>There will be an award for the best paper from the accepted program. This award will be given to the paper judged to
    have the highest overall quality as determined by the program committee. Key elements of the selection process
    include whether papers include evaluation, repeatable results, and open-source data or software. Authors of the best
    paper will be invited for submission to Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics. Both full and short
    papers are eligible.</p>
<p>There will also be an award for <strong>Best Presentation</strong> and an award for <strong>Best Poster</strong>.
    Each award comes with a $50 USD
    Amazon gift card thanks to our sponsor, Two Six Labs. These awards will recognize authors’ efforts to clearly and
    concisely present their work to the audience. The awards will be determined by anonymous judges and given to
    recipients at the end of the conference.</p>
