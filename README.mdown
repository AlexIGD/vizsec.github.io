File structure 

* source - source files, including jade templates and css, image and javascript assets
* deploy - files to be put on the web server, compressed and minified

To prepare source files for deployment you need to build the html files using [Jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade), which is already installed in the `node_modules` directory. To use it, you must have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed. The `Makefile` is set up to compile the jade templates in source into deploy. The `Makefile` will also concatenate the css into a single file and minify, and concatenate and minify the javascript (currently only bootstrap.js). Simply run the make command:

    make

# development

The basic framework is provided by [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

Web pages are written in [jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade), which compiles into HTML.

Javascript is minified using [uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS).

CSS is compiled and minified using [recess](https://github.com/twitter/recess).
