# vizsec web site

File structure 

* source - source files, including jade templates and css, image and javascript assets
* deploy - files to be put on the web server, compressed and minified

To build the source files, you must have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed. Then install the required modules:

    npm install -d
    
[Grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) is used as the build tool. This will compile the jade templates in source into deploy, as well as concatenate the css into a single file and minify, and concatenate and minify the javascript (currently only bootstrap.js).

# development

The basic framework is provided by [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

Web pages are written in [jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade), which compiles into HTML.

Javascript is minified using [uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS).

CSS is compiled and minified using [recess](https://github.com/twitter/recess).
