We are excited to announce that this year's VizSec will award a Best Paper prize to the best full or short paper from the program! The prize is a $100 Amazon gift card, thanks to the generous support of [Invincea Labs](https://www.invincealabs.com/).

This award will be given to paper judged to have the highest overall quality. Key criteria include whether the paper includes evaluation, repeatable results, and open-source data or software.
