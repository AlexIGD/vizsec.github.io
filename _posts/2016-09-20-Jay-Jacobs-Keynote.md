Jay Jacobs will provide the Keynote talk entitled _The State of (Viz) Security_ at VizSec 2016. The information security industry is changing rapidly (like always). It's worthwhile to take a moment to stop and look around to figure out if we are still on a good path. Join Jay Jacobs as he takes looks back over his career along with 12 years of VizSec and takes stock of where we are and some areas we should be moving towards.
