We are pleased to announce that the VizSec 2019 Call for Papers is officially open!
 
<p>The 16th IEEE Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec) is a forum that brings together
    researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry to address the needs of the cyber
    security community through new and insightful visualization and analysis techniques. VizSec provides an
    excellent venue for fostering greater exchange and new collaborations on a broad range of security- and
    privacy-related topics. VizSec will be held in <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> in conjunction with <a
        href="http://ieeevis.org/">IEEE VIS</a>, on <strong>Wednesday, October 23rd 2019</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    This year, VizSec will be more closely integrated with the IEEE VIS program. VizSec will take place
    during the main week of the conference, giving VizSec authors and attendees enhanced access to IEEE VIS,
    the premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual
    analytics.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of VizSec is to explore effective and scalable visual interfaces for security domains such
    as network security, computer forensics, reverse engineering, insider threat detection, cryptography,
    privacy, user assisted attacks prevention, compliance management, wireless security, secure coding, and
    penetration testing.
</p>
We look forward to your submissions, and to hearing about your experiences at VizSec in October!
