        h2 History
      p VizSec started in 2004 as the <a href='http://www.cs.fit.edu/~pkc/vizdmsec04/'>Workshop on Visualization and Data Mining for Computer Security</a> at <a href='http://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2004/workshops.html'>ACM CCS</a>. After that first event, the event got bigger and bigger each year as it rotated between a visualization-focused conference and a security-focused conference. After several different publishers for the proceedings, VizSec in 2010 began to publish proceedings with <a href='https://dl.acm.org/icps.cfm'>ACM ICPS</a>.
