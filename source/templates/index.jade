      h4 Clay Moody
      p <strong>A Holistic Operational Framework for Establishing Situational Awareness in Cyberspace</strong>
      p William Clay Moody is a US Army Major and Army Fellow at Clemson University. He is a member of Clemson's Big Data Systems lab researching alternative optimizations methodologies for big data systems. He has an appointment to the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at West Point, the United States Military Academy following his Ph.D. studies.  Clay is a founding member and former Cyber Battle Captain for the US Cyber Command, Fort Meade, MD. Clay also served as the Cyber Defense Operations advisor to the Commander of US Forces in Iraq.
      p Our nation, including the Department of Defense, relies heavily on information systems and networking technologies to efficiently conduct a wide variety of missions across the globe. With the ever- increasing rate of cyber attacks, this dependency places the nation at risk of a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its critical information resources; degrading its ability to complete the mission. In this talk, we will present a Holistic Operational Framework for Establishing Situational Awareness in Cyberspace (HOFESAC), whose goal is to provide the nation’s leadership timely and accurate information to gain an understanding of the operational cyber environment to enable strategic, operational, and tactical decision making. In doing so, we present the key information components of cyber situational awareness and present a hypothetical case study demonstrating how they must be consolidated to provide a clear and relevant picture to a commander. In addition, current organizational and technical challenges are discussed, and areas for future research are addressed.

        h2 Call for Papers
      p The 10th Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec) is a forum that brings together researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry to address the needs of the cyber security community through new and insightful visualization and analysis techniques. VizSec will provide an excellent venue for fostering greater exchange and new collaborations on a broad range of security- and privacy-related topics. Accepted papers will appear in the ACM Digital Library as part of the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series.
      p Important research problems often lie at the intersection of disparate domains. Our focus is to explore effective, scalable visual interfaces for security domains, where visualization may provide a distinct benefit, including computer forensics, reverse engineering, insider threat detection, cryptography, privacy, preventing 'user assisted' attacks, compliance management, wireless security, secure coding, and penetration testing in addition to traditional network security. Human time and attention are precious resources. We are particularly interested in visualization and interaction techniques that effectively capture human analyst insights so that further processing may be handled by machines, freeing the analyst for other tasks. For example, a malware analyst might use a visualization system to analyze a new piece of malicious software and then facilitate generating a signature for future machine processing. When appropriate, research that incorporates multiple data sources, such as network packet captures, firewall rule sets and logs, DNS logs, web server logs, and/or intrusion detection system logs, is particularly desirable.

      h3 Technical Papers
      p Full papers offering novel contributions in security visualization are solicited. Papers may present techniques, applications, practical experience, theory, analysis, or experiments and evaluations. We encourage papers on technologies and methods that promise to improve cyber security practices, including, but not limited to:
      ul
        li Situational awareness / understanding
        li Incident handling including triage, exploration, correlation, and response
        li Computer forensics
        li Recording and reporting results of investigation
        li Reverse engineering and malware analysis
        li Multiple data source analysis
        li Analyzing information requirements for computer network defense
        li Evaluation / User testing of VizSec systems
        li Criteria for assessing the effectiveness of cyber security visualizations (whether from a security goal perspective or a human factors perspective)
        li Modeling system and network behavior
        li Modeling attacker and defender behavior
        li Studying risk and impact of cyber attacks
        li Predicting future attacks or targets
        li Security metrics and education
        li Software security 
        li Mobile application security
        li Social networking privacy and security
        li Cyber intelligence
        li Human factors in cyber security
      
      h3 Posters
      p Poster submissions may showcase late-breaking results, work in progress, preliminary results, or visual representations relevant to the VizSec community. Accepted poster abstracts will be made available on this website.

      h3 Awards
      p There will be an award for the best paper from the accepted program. The best paper award will be given to the paper judged to have the highest overall quality. A key element of the best paper selection process will be whether the results are believed to be repeatable by other scientists based on the algorithms and data provided in the paper. This award will be chosen by the program committee.
      
      h3 Data
      p If you do not have real-world data to demonstrate your visualization, you may be interested in looking at the <a href="http://www.vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2012">VAST 2012 Challenge data</a>. <a href="http://hcil.cs.umd.edu/localphp/hcil/vast11/index.php">VAST 2011</a> also had cyber security data if you are looking for additional data.
