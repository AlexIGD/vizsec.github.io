The IEEE VizSec Symposium is inviting support from industry, academia, and government contributors in security and data visualization.

As a supporter, we encourage you to join us at VizSec 2016, colocated with <a href="http://ieeevis.org">VIS 2016</a> this October in Baltimore. Supporters receive several new benefits this year:

* <strong>Recruitment</strong> — supporters will engage with the talented students and professionals that attend VizSec and VIS 2016, many of whom are actively seeking internships, employment, and collaboration opportunities.
* <strong>Exhibition</strong> — many levels of support include dedicated exhibition space for your organization at VIS 2016.
* <strong>Registration</strong> — most levels include one or more complimentary registrations for representatives from your organization.
* <strong>Exposure</strong> — for all support levels, your organization’s logos will be prominently displayed at all conference events, on the conference web site, and in any conference materials.


### Support Options

Please see the <a href="/files/2016/vis_prospectus_16.pdf">IEEE VIS Support Prospectus</a> for support options. For more information on becoming a sponsor, please email <a href="mailto:sponsor@vizsec.com">sponsor@vizsec.com</a>.


### Other Opportunities

We are open to other suggestions from supporters as well. Past attendees have offered several ideas for specific opportunities at VizSec organizations may be interested in supporting, including:

* Diversity scholarships
* Lunch, dinner, or meetups for attendees
* Coffee breaks
* Best Paper Award


### VizSec Highlights

VizSec has been rapidly growing in recent years — both in attendance and in the diversity of our attendees and their work.
