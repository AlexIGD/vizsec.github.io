<h5>Maintaining Context</h5>

<p>What is the most difficult challenge to using visualization tools to obtain and maintain cyber situational awareness? Is it the data? Analytics? Stale dashboards or displays? Users? My vote is context. Visualization tools often fail to obtain significant adoption or user acceptance because the context obtained at one level of sharing (strategy, operational, tactical, or technical) is lost when viewed by different people, teams, or at a different level. Developing visualization strategies and tools that enable users to integrate data and information while maintaining context through the various levels of sharing is critical to achieving useful situational awareness in cyber and can be a vital feature in advancing the art of cyber security.</p>

<h5>Biography</h5>

<p>Mr. Alexander Gates serves as the Director of the Cyber Directorate for the Department of Energy's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence. He leads a diverse workforce that orchestrates the production and delivery of cyber intelligence and security services to key Department of Energy (DOE) customers and stakeholders. Mr. Gates works collaboratively across the government, national labs, industry, and academia to solve complex problems spanning a broad spectrum of information assurance and cyber security issues.</p>

<p>Mr. Gates brings a wealth of cyber-related technical, analytic, and leadership experiences to his current position at DOE, together with an impressive intelligence background. Before moving to DOE in 2016, Mr. Gates served as a technical director in the Nation Security Agency's (NSA) Information Assurance Directorate, whose mission is to protect and defend U.S. national security systems. As technical director, he led and advised on operations and research activities, often working collaborative across the government. He also served as the director of NSA's Cyber Integration Lab. In this role, Mr. Gates led the development of innovative technical and tradecraft solutions for integration into NSA's cyber mission elements, geared towards measurably improving NSA's ability to perform cyber analysis and operations. Mr. Gates also served in various leadership roles in the NSA Threat Operations Center and the NSA Threat Analysis Center where he specialized in cyber threat and the delivery of actionable intelligence and solutions to protect the nation against cyber threats. Earlier in his career, Mr. Gates amassed over two decades of service working in the intelligence, information operations, and military communities. He began his cryptologic career in 1983 when he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. During his military career, he served as a supervisor, project manager, and intelligence analyst at stations in the United States and abroad. Mr. Gates joined the NSA as a civilian in 2002 while assigned to the Information Operations Technology Center, a joint DOD and Intelligence Community organization, where he served as senior analyst, supervisor, and program manager until 2004.</p>

<p>Mr. Gates holds a BS degree in Business Administration from Wayland Baptist University and a Masters of Public Administration degree from the University of Oklahoma. He also completed a graduate certificate program in Information and Telecommunications Systems from John Hopkins University.</p>

<h3>Panel</h3>

<h5>Moderators: LTC Stoney Trent, US Cyber Command and Anita D'Amico, Secure Decisions</h5>
<h6>Use of Visualizations in DoD Cyberspace Operations</h6>

<p>While information visualization researchers and designers continue to develop new cyber security visualizations, little attention has been paid to how currently-fielded visualizations are actually used in cyberspace operations. Lathrop and Trent (2016) introduce the differences between traditional cyber security roles and expertise and emerging roles and technology requirements in cyber security operations. Cyber technologies and cyberspace operations organizations are co-evolving, so it is critical for researchers to understand practitioner perspectives. U.S. Cyber Command has established a research activity, the Cyber Immersion Lab, that is supporting such understanding. This panel, facilitated by the Cyber Immersion Lab, will provide an overview of the Cyber Mission Force and roles that perform cyberspace operations. Cyber Mission Force members will share insights into how visualizations are currently being used as well as perspectives on how currently-fielded visualizations fail to support real cyber work. Additional time will be reserved for questions and answers.</p>

<h3>Call for Papers</h3>

<p>
The 14th IEEE Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec) brings together researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry to address the needs of the cyber security community through new and insightful visualization and analysis techniques. VizSec provides an excellent venue for fostering greater exchange and new collaborations on a broad range of security- and privacy-related topics. VizSec will be held in <strong>Phoenix, AZ, USA</strong> in conjunction with <a href="http://ieeevis.org/">IEEE VIS</a>, on <strong>Monday, October 2nd, 2017.</strong>
</p>
<p>
VizSec explores effective and scalable visual interfaces for security domains such as network security, computer forensics, reverse engineering, insider threat detection, cryptography, privacy, user assisted attacks prevention, compliance management, wireless security, secure coding, and penetration testing.
</p>
<p>
VizSec solicits both full and short papers, both of which will be published in the proceedings that will be published by IEEE. Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference.
</p>

<h4>Technical Papers</h4>
<p>
Full papers describing novel contributions in security visualization are solicited. Papers may present techniques, applications, theory, analysis, experiments, or evaluations. We encourage the submission of papers on technologies and methods that improve cyber security practices, including, but not limited to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Situation awareness and/or understanding</li>
  <li>Incident handling including triage, exploration, correlation, and response</li>
  <li>Computer forensics</li>
  <li>Recording and reporting results of investigations</li>
  <li>Assisting proactive security configuration and deployment</li>

<p>
When applicable, visualization and interaction techniques that effectively capture the insights of human analysts and/or allow analysts to collaborate efficiently are particularly desirable.
</p>

<p>
Submissions including tests and evaluations of existing tools and techniques are also considered particularly desirable. If possible, making the data used for the tests available will also be considered positively. If you do not have real-world data to demonstrate your visualization, you may be interested in looking at the <a href="http://vizsec.org/data/">VizSec Data Sets</a> page.
</p>

<h4>Short Papers</h4>
<p>
Short papers describing practical applications of security visualization are solicited. We encourage the submission of papers discussing the introduction of cyber security visualizations into operational context, including, but not limited to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cases where visualization made positive contributions towards meeting operational needs</li>
  <li>Gaps or negative outcomes from visualization deployments</li>
  <li>Situations where visualization was not utilized, but could have had a positive impact</li>
  <li>Lessons learned from operational engagements</li>
  <li>Insights gained from the transition process</li>
</ul>

<p>
<br/>
Cyber security practitioners from industry, as well as the research community, are encouraged to submit case studies.
</p>

<h4>Posters</h4>
<p>
Poster submissions may showcase late-breaking results, work in progress, preliminary results, or visual representations relevant to the VizSec community. The poster program will be a great opportunity for the authors to interact with the attendees and solicit feedback. Accepted poster abstracts will be made available on the VizSec website.
</p>

<a class="page-anchor" id="awards"></a>
<h3>Awards</h3>
<p>
There will be an award for the best paper from the accepted program. This award will be given to the paper judged to have the highest overall quality as determined by the program committee. Key elements of the selection process include whether papers include evaluation, repeatable results, and open-source data or software. Both full and short papers are eligible.
</p>
